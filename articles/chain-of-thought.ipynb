    "Yes, it covers main consepts. And no, I wouldn't trast more than a dollar to this particular one (even if we don't take into account lots of small missing parts). When I started this quest I suspected that its possible to uncover details that I wouldn't find just by reading articles about blockchain. The digest of what I learned while writing this simple blockchain is in `Code Hash` article."

    "I went on a quset to implement cryptocurency consepts in code. In my prevous article `In code we trust` I argued that one must impement cryptocurency consepts in code in order to understand them. I still stand by that statement but now I understood why very few blogers do that. It is very borring to read. Don't get me wrong it was fun to think about it and write code but I must be honest with myself and admit that very few people will want to read it carefully. My `Chain of thought` jupyter notebook is for those brave soles. The rest of the article focuses on lessons I learned while writing code for a simple blockchain.\n",

    "## Not money\n",
    "It's better to not think of cryptocurrency as money. It's an immutable list with transactions. When you add entities that maintain the ladger and validate each outhers entries, the most apparant application is to \"send\" units of value from one address to another. The true value of such ladgers comes from enabaling cooperation between people, autobeings, aliens, unicorns, or anything else that follows the protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Not complicated\n",
    "It turns out that the main consepts are very simple. I reconstructed them with very few lines of code starting from a simple list of transactions and hardening it against temparing. Specific implementation matters a lot. That is what separates successful coin worth millions of dollars from worthless crap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not a database\n",
    "I kind of knew that before but I didn't realy appriciated how special the first and the last blocks are. Blockchain itself is a crappy database. It's only good for verifying chain integety. It's incredebly ineficient event at that task. Any blockchain should have better data format on top of it. It would be interesting to check what data formats are used by famous coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game of rulles\n",
    "It's facinating that a lot of coin rules don't need to be spelled out explicitly in the blockchain. They are reinforced only by miner implementation. For example blockchain doesn't need to contain wallet balances. It's calculated by summing up all the transactions with the wallet. This is cool feature but it's easy to create ambigious rulles or rulles with uninteded consiqunces. Let's say we allow some negative balance in our transactions. It might work for a while untill some smart soule realizes that she can create wallets, empty them down to that negative amount into another wallet, and abandon the once with negative amount. Even though the example is simple relationship between negative account balance and the ability to limitlessly print the coin is not very apperant. It seems to me that complexity increases with the number of those rules. With complexity the chanse that something like that is possible increases as well.\n",

    "## Validation right\n",
    "Destributing validation right using prof of work is genious but it feels wrong. It reminds me the famous Arthur C. Clark story [The Nine Billion Names of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_Billion_Names_of_God). No wonder people are looking for alternatives. I wish there was some quantum randomnes law that could distribute validation right and didn't accept bribes. I doubt it's possible in this universe though.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's next?\n",
    "First I'm going to look into some real blockchain fromats like Bitcon, Etherioum, Steem, and maybe another interesting coin. There must be immutable database-like structures that are alrady implemented. After that I'll work on some tools that can tell me some stats about blockchains. For example I'm very courious what's the ususal Bitcoin tail. The rule is that the longest chain wins but how many blocks die on average replaced by a longer chain."
