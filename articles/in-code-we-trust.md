# In code we trust

If crypto bills could have slogans this would be it.

## Why bother with code?

## Why do it on steemit?

I wonder if calling an entity a bot will soon be politically incorrect. Maybe we'll call them autobeings.

## What if there is nothing fundamentally good about cryptocurency? Wouldn't you just waste your time learning about it? 

## How are gonna go about it?
The general plan is to split concepts into biteable chunks, pick a concept and implement it in code, 
write steemit post about it, listen to what people and autobeings have to say, make corrections
or improvements, and repeat all the steps building on already implemented code. The approach is no different from
writing any other complicated software. It's not possible to grasp all blockchain complexity at once but it's possible
to do it in series of software patches and small blog posts.

## Where should we star?
Nothing is new under the sun. This statement might not be true in general but it holds in our specific case.
Let's not waste all that good work.

### Here is what I found:

1) Article about [learning blockchains by building one](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)
 and related [repository](https://github.com/dvf/blockchain) that inspired this entire project.
 
2) blockchain [tutorial](https://github.com/adilmoujahid/blockchain-python-tutorial)
related [blog post](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2018/03/intro-blockchain-bitcoin-python/)

3) [tutorial](https://github.com/satwikkansal/python_blockchain_app)

4) Another [blockchain](https://github.com/jackschultz/jbc) implementation

5) bitcoin [book](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)

6) [simple coin](https://github.com/cosme12/SimpleCoin)

7) a more useful [project](https://github.com/alecalve/python-bitcoin-blockchain-parser) that analyzes actual bitcoin blockchain

8) Satoshi Nakimoto [paper](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/shatoshi-paper/blob/master/markdown/bitcoin.md).
You can find different formats in the repository. For some reason I like it in Mark Down format a little more
than [pdf version of the paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
